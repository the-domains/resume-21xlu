  Unfolding over the course of a single, stressful day, "11:55" follows Nelson
  (Victor Almanzar), a young Marine who returns home from Afghanistan to
  discover that he has simply exchanged one unfinished war for another. Yet this
  first feature from Ari Issler and Ben Snyder (who both wrote the script with
  Mr. Almanzar, a military veteran) refuses to revel in violence.
